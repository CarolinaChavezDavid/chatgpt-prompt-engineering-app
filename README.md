GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer)

In these repository you can find information about how to engineer an effective prompt in order to create an application aid by ChatGPT

 GPT is model of languaje based on  redes neuronalesn capable of identifying our lenguaje, it is a genearative model, giving a text it can generate words

## Best practices

### LLMS (Large Language Models)
### Base LLM
Predicts new word, based on text training data.
### Instruction Tuned LLM
* Tries to follow instrucctions
* Fine-tune on instructions and good attemps at following those instructions
* It started as Base LLM and then is train with RLHF (ReinforcementLEarning with Human Feedback)
* Helpful, Honest, Harmless

## Principle of Prompting
* Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
  * Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
  * Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
  * Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
  * Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
 
* Principle 2: Give the model time to think
  * Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task
  * Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

## Model Limitations
* Hallucinations
It can make statements that sounds plausible but are not true

Ther isn't a perfect prompt, It's more important to have a process for developing a good prompt for your specific application.

## Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics.
